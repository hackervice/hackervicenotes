# Insecure Direct Object References

**Overview of IDOR Vulnerabilities** Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) are prevalent web vulnerabilities that can severely compromise web applications. These vulnerabilities arise when a web application exposes direct references to objects, such as files or database resources, allowing users to manipulate these references to access unauthorized resources. If a user can access resources without proper access controls, the application is deemed vulnerable.

**Challenges in Access Control** Creating a robust access control system is complex, which contributes to the widespread nature of IDOR vulnerabilities. Additionally, automating the identification of weaknesses in access control systems is challenging, often leaving these vulnerabilities undetected until they are in production.

**Example of IDOR Vulnerability** Consider a scenario where users can download their uploaded files via a link like `download.php?file_id=123`. If a user attempts to access another file using `download.php?file_id=124`, and the application lacks proper backend access controls, they may gain access to files that do not belong to them. Often, these identifiers (file IDs) are easily guessable, enabling unauthorized access to multiple files.

#### What Constitutes an IDOR Vulnerability?

Simply exposing a direct reference to an internal object is not inherently a vulnerability. The risk arises from a weak access control system. Many applications restrict access to resources through pages, functions, and APIs. However, if a user can access these pages (e.g., via a shared or guessed link), they may exploit the lack of backend access control to access restricted resources.

**Implementing Access Control** A solid access control system, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), is essential. The key takeaway is that IDOR vulnerabilities stem from inadequate backend access control. If users have direct references to objects without proper checks, attackers can view or modify other users' data.

Many developers overlook the importance of access control, leaving web and mobile applications vulnerable. In such cases, users may have unrestricted access to other users' data, with only front-end restrictions preventing access. Manipulating HTTP requests can reveal that all users can access all data, leading to successful attacks.

#### The Critical Nature of IDOR Vulnerabilities

IDOR vulnerabilities are among the most critical for web and mobile applications due to the lack of a solid access control system. Even basic access control can be difficult to implement, and creating a comprehensive system that functions seamlessly across the application is even more challenging. This complexity is why IDOR vulnerabilities persist in large applications like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

#### Impact of IDOR Vulnerabilities

IDOR vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, such as unauthorized access to private files and sensitive information, including personal files and credit card data. This is known as IDOR Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities. Depending on the exposed references, attackers may also modify or delete other users' data, potentially leading to account takeovers.

Once attackers identify direct references (like database IDs or URL parameters), they can test various patterns to access data, ultimately learning how to extract or modify data for any user.

**Privilege Escalation Risks** IDOR vulnerabilities can also facilitate privilege escalation, allowing standard users to perform administrative functions. For instance, if a web application exposes admin-only URL parameters or APIs in the frontend code but does not restrict access on the backend, a standard user could exploit this to perform unauthorized actions, such as changing passwords or granting roles, potentially leading to a complete takeover of the application.

#### Conclusion

In summary, IDOR vulnerabilities pose significant risks to web applications due to inadequate access control systems. Understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for developers to protect user data and maintain the integrity of their applications.
