# IDOR Prevention

**Understanding IDOR Vulnerabilities**

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities arise from improper access control on back-end servers, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is essential to implement robust access control mechanisms and secure object referencing.

**Object-Level Access Control**

At the heart of any secure web application lies an effective Access Control system. This system should support the segmentation of roles and permissions in a centralized manner, particularly focusing on Object-Level Access Control (OLAC) to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities.

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   * RBAC is a critical component of access control systems, where user roles and permissions are mapped to all objects and resources.
   * Each user is assigned a role with specific privileges, and every request is evaluated against these roles to determine access rights.
2.  **Implementation Example**: A sample code snippet illustrates how to enforce access control based on user roles:

    ```javascript
    match /api/profile/{userId} {
        allow read, write: if user.isAuth == true
        && (user.uid == userId || user.roles == 'admin');
    }
    ```

    In this example, access is granted only if the user's ID matches the requested object ID or if the user has an admin role. This approach ensures that user privileges are not passed through the HTTP request but are instead validated against the back-end RBAC system using the user's session token.
3. **Security Considerations**:
   * Avoid storing user roles in cookies or user details, as these can be manipulated. Instead, rely on secure session tokens to manage user authentication and authorization.

**Object Referencing**

While robust access control is crucial, the way objects are referenced also plays a significant role in preventing IDOR vulnerabilities.

1. **Avoid Direct Object References**:
   * Direct references (e.g., `uid=1`) can be easily enumerated and exploited. Instead, use strong, unique references such as salted hashes or UUIDs.
2. **Using UUIDs**:
   * Generate UUIDs (e.g., `89c9b29b-d19f-4515-b2dd-abb6e693eb20`) for object references. These UUIDs should be mapped to the corresponding objects in the back-end database.
3.  **Implementation Example**: A PHP code snippet demonstrates how to securely reference objects:

    ```php
    $uid = intval($_REQUEST['uid']);
    $query = "SELECT url FROM documents WHERE uid=" . $uid;
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
    $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);
    echo "<a href='" . $row['url'] . "' target='_blank'></a>";
    ```

    In this example, the UID is used to query the database securely, ensuring that direct object references are not exposed.
4. **Hash Generation**:
   * Always generate hashes on the back end when an object is created, and store them in the database. This prevents front-end manipulation and ensures integrity.

**Conclusion**

To effectively prevent IDOR vulnerabilities, it is essential to implement a strong access control system alongside secure object referencing. By utilizing RBAC and unique identifiers like UUIDs, web applications can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and exploitation. While these measures enhance security, continuous testing and monitoring are necessary to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
