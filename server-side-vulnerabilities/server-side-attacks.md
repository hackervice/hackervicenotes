# Server-side Attacks

Server-side attacks target the application or service provided by a server, whereas a client-side attack takes place at the client's machine, not the server itself. Understanding and identifying the differences is essential for penetration testing and bug bounty hunting.

For instance, vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) target the web browser, i.e., the client. On the other hand, server-side attacks target the web server. In this module, we will discuss four classes of server-side vulnerabilities:

* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
* Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection
* eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) Server-Side Injection
