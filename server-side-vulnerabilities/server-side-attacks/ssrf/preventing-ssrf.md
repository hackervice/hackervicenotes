# Preventing SSRF

**Prevention Techniques**

1. **Implement Whitelisting**:
   * Create a whitelist of allowed remote origins from which the web application can fetch data.
   * Ensure that any user-supplied URLs are checked against this whitelist to prevent requests to arbitrary origins.
2. **Restrict URL Schemes and Protocols**:
   * Limit the URL schemes (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) and protocols that the application can use.
   * Hardcode allowed protocols or validate them against a predefined whitelist to prevent the use of arbitrary protocols.
3. **Sanitize User Input**:
   * Implement input sanitization to clean and validate any user-supplied data.
   * This helps prevent unexpected behavior that could lead to SSRF vulnerabilities.
4. **Configure Firewall Rules**:
   * Set up appropriate firewall rules to block outgoing requests to unauthorized or unexpected remote systems.
   * Ensure that the firewall is configured to drop any outgoing requests that could exploit SSRF vulnerabilities.
5. **Utilize Network Segmentation**:
   * Implement network segmentation to isolate critical internal systems from the web application.
   * This limits the potential impact of SSRF vulnerabilities by preventing attackers from accessing sensitive internal resources.
