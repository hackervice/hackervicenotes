# Futher Remarks

The exploration of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in template engines like Jinja and Twig highlights the nuances in their syntax and functionality. While each engine has its unique characteristics, the fundamental principles of SSTI exploitation remain consistent across different platforms. For an attacker, understanding the specific syntax and features of a new template engine can often be accomplished by consulting its documentation. Additionally, resources such as SSTI cheat sheets, including the well-known [PayloadsAllTheThings SSTI CheatSheet](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/README.md), provide a valuable collection of payloads tailored for various template engines, facilitating the exploitation process. This underscores the importance of familiarity with the tools at hand and the availability of community resources in the realm of security testing.
