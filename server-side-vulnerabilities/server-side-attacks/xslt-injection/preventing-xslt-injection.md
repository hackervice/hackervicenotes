# Preventing XSLT Injection

To effectively prevent XSLT injection vulnerabilities, it is crucial to implement robust security measures that address the risks associated with user input.

**Prevention Strategies**

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure that user input is not directly inserted into XSL data before processing by the XSLT processor. If user-provided data must be included in the XSL document, it is essential to implement thorough sanitization and validation. This helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious XSLT elements.
2. **HTML-Encoding**: If the XSLT processor generates an HTML response, HTML-encode user input before inserting it into the XSL data. This process converts characters like `<` to `&lt;` and `>` to `&gt;`, effectively neutralizing potential XSLT injection attempts.
3. **Run with Low Privileges**: Configure the XSLT processor to run as a low-privilege process. This limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict if they exploit an XSLT injection vulnerability.
4. **Disable External Functions**: Prevent the use of external functions by disabling PHP functions within the XSLT environment. This reduces the risk of executing arbitrary commands through XSLT injection.
5. **Keep Libraries Updated**: Regularly update the XSLT library to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched, further enhancing the security of the application.
