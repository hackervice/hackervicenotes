# Vertical privilege escalation

Vertical privilege escalation is a critical security concern in access control, where a user gains unauthorized access to higher-level functionalities or permissions than they are entitled to. Understanding this concept is essential for identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in systems.

**Definition:**

* **Vertical Privilege Escalation:** Occurs when a user is able to access functionalities or resources that exceed their authorized permissions.

**Example:**

* A non-administrative user accessing an admin page that allows them to delete user accounts exemplifies vertical privilege escalation. This unauthorized access can lead to significant security breaches and data loss.
