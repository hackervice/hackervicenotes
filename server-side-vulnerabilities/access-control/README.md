# Access control

Access control is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity, particularly in web applications. It ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions or access certain resources. Understanding the components and implications of access control is crucial for maintaining security and preventing vulnerabilities.

**Access Control Overview:**

* Access control involves setting constraints on who or what can perform actions or access resources.
* In web applications, it relies heavily on two key components: authentication and session management.

**Key Components:**

1. **Authentication:**
   * Verifies the identity of the user (ensures they are who they claim to be).
2. **Session Management:**
   * Tracks which HTTP requests are made by the authenticated user during their session.
3. **Access Control:**
   * Determines if the authenticated user has permission to perform the requested action.

**Security Implications:**

* Broken access controls are a frequent and critical security vulnerability.
* Designing and managing access controls is complex, requiring consideration of business, organizational, and legal constraints alongside technical implementation.
* Human error in access control design is a significant risk due to the complexity of decisions involved.
