# HTTP Requests

### Try applying what you learned in this section by sending a 'POST' request to '/serial.php'. What is the response you get?

This lab is a little bit too straightforward, as the only thing we have to do is a cURL with a POST request to '/serial.php'.

```sh
curl http://94.237.58.102:36075/serial.php -X POST  
```

And we managed to get the information we were looking for.
