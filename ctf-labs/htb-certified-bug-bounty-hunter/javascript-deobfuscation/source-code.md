# Source Code

### Repeat what you learned in this section, and you should find a secret flag, what is it?

For this lab we just have to put together the info learned in this section.

We start by accessing the target on our web browser.

Then we press `CTRL + U` to view the source code:

And if we scroll down we can see the flag.
